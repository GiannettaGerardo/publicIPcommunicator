# publicIPcommunicator
This program is useful for those who need a static public IP address for a server but do not have one available, so it allows you to always have the dynamic public IP address available wherever you are, by e-mail. Communicate the public IP address of the computer on which the program is running by sending an e-mail wherever you want. It remains listening for connection, when the connection is lost or the router/modem is restarted, the program finds the "new" public IP address and sends it back.
